# Advance-Analytics-and-Dashboard-Design
## Objective
To build an interactive dashboard visually showcasing well-curated results of
an advanced exploratory analysis conducted in Python.

### Context
For this Achievement, you’ll select your own data to analyze. You’ll first conduct an exploratory visual
analysis in Python before identifying connections between variables worth further exploration. Then,
after developing hypotheses, you’ll use various advanced analytical approaches to help test them
before presenting your results in a Tableau dashboard/storyboard.
Data dashboards are an effective tool for presenting data in an accessible and tangible way. Your
dashboard will tell the story of your analytical journey and should contain a curation of the key results
you discovered throughout this Achievement. Not all of your results will fit into the dashboard—make
sure to include any additional analyses you conducted in a GitHub repository.

### Data Requirements
Your chosen data must meet specific criteria so that you can conduct the procedures explored in this
Achievement (and develop the necessary skills for a junior analyst). You’ll likely need to source
multiple data sets while working through the Achievement; however, we advise you to start with one
main data set. Keep in mind that data sourcing can be very time-consuming!
The data set(s) you choose must:
● Be open source;
● Come from an authentic/authoritative source;
● Include non-anonymized column names;
● Be no more than 3 years old (up to a maximum of 10 years if you’ve found a perfect data set
for your needs and no newer data is available);
● Contain at least 2 continuous variables (excluding index or ID variables, dates, years, etc.);
● Contain at least 2 categorical variables (excluding index or ID variables, dates, years, etc.);
● Contain at least 1,500 rows;
● Include a geographical component with at least 2 different values (e.g., countries, continents,
U.S. states, cities, latitude and longitude values—anything you can visualize on a map!).

Note: Later in the Achievement, you’ll source a time series data set, too. You’ll learn more about that in
the corresponding Exercise, so don’t worry about it for now.
In summary, the most important feature your data set(s) must contain is a geographic object—you’ll
need this data to conduct a geospatial analysis. In Exercise 6.1, we’ve suggested different data types
you could use for this project based on your professional experience and goals.
